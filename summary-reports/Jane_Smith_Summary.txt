Chief Complaint:

The patient presents with a recent onset of persistent hematuria and dysuria, accompanied by lower abdominal discomfort and generalized fatigue.

Diagnosis:

Based on the clinical presentation and physical examination findings, the patient is provisionally diagnosed with prostate cancer.

Further diagnostic evaluation, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy, will be pursued to confirm the diagnosis and determine disease staging.

Assessment and Plan:

Diagnostic Workup: Ms. Smith will undergo PSA testing to assess prostate-specific antigen levels, along with transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate gland to obtain tissue samples for histopathological examination.

Multidisciplinary Consultation: A multidisciplinary team, including urologists, oncologists, and radiologists, will be involved in the management of the patient to develop an individualized treatment plan based on disease staging and patient preferences.

Patient Education: Ms. Smith and her family will receive comprehensive education regarding the nature of prostate cancer, treatment options, potential side effects, and supportive care resources.

Psychosocial Support: Given the psychological impact of a cancer diagnosis, Ms. Smith will be offered access to counseling services and support groups to address emotional distress and coping strategies.

Prognosis:

The prognosis for prostate cancer varies depending on the stage of disease at the time of diagnosis, histological grade, and response to treatment.
