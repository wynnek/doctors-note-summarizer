# Doctor's Note Summarizer

This project summarizes a doctor's note in a way that is easy for the patient to understand.

## Project and Work Product Description:

A doctor or other healthcare provider may write a note to describe a health care visit, telephone call, or other patient interaction. The problem is that the doctor's report is often full of medical terminology and procedural shorthand that is too complex for most patients to understand. Our goal is to make a doctor's note more accessible for their patient to comprehend.

| The Project As-Is: | The Project To-Be: |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| ![image info](./diagrams/diagram1.png) | ![image info](./diagrams/diagram2.png) |
| **File Format:** Input any text file (.txt). Output a text file (.txt). | **File Format:** Input text and images of a doctor's handwritten notes. Output simplified English text with voice audio option |
| **Python Packages:** NLTK | **Python Packages:** TensorFlow/Keras, NLTK |

## Description of Solution: 

We use artificial intelligence (AI) and the Python programming language to simplify a doctor's note in layman's terms. Our vision is that all patients with various levels of education, class, and abilities (sight, hearing, etc) can better understand and access their doctor's note with the help of technology as a translator.

* Minimum Viable Product (MVP) 1.0 delivered:
In the completed version 1.0 of this project:
  1) Code has been developed to input a doctor's note, as a .txt fle
  2) A fake doctor's notes generated by ChatGPT can be successfully selected to be parsed
  3) Output a summary.txt file

* Later MVP, i.e., v2, v3, vN+ functionality to be delivered
For future enhancements, in the next versions of this project:
  * Version 1.1: Clean up Technical Debt
    * Inform the user that .txt files are the only file type accepted
    * Cleanup Code - remove code references to a deprecated feature (we are no longer accepting .docx and .xlsx file input)
    * Fine-tune output files
    * Create output files with DATETIME
    * Improved Text Formatting: Updated the write_to_txt function in Doc_Rpt_Writer.py to improve the formatting of the output text. The function now correctly handles abbreviations like "Ms." and does not break the line after them. This was achieved by using the nltk.tokenize.sent_tokenize function to split the summary into sentences.
    * Removed Leading Spaces: Modified the write_to_txt function to remove any leading spaces from the summary.
    * Updated Header Formatting: Adjusted the formatting of the headers in the summary. The values of the headers "Patient Name", "Date of Birth", and "Date of Consultation" are now on the same line as the headers themselves, rather than on a new line.
    * Created Summary Reports Directory: Updated the write_to_txt function to create a directory named 'summary-reports' if it does not already exist. This is where the function saves the formatted summary reports.
    * Inform the user to provide more information about what the app does. The app reads in a patient's medical report and writes it into a more easily readable format, without the heavy technical medical or health-related terminologies.

  * Version 1.5: Quality Assurance
    * QA the Input files - Make sure the ChatGPT input files make sense (Sample_Report files)
    * QA the Output file - Make sure the AI returned good data (actual easy English summary of doctor's note)
  * Version 2.0: Generate fake doctor's notes dynamically, so they can be selected by the user as input text files
  * Version 3.0: Read handwriting images
  * Version 4.0: Output voice audio
  * Version 5.0: Doctor's Note to MRI person or other nurse

## Solution Design (high-level):

This project uses Faker, pandas, docx, nltk, and streamlit libraries to generate, process, and summarize a doctor's report (input as a .txt file)

## Solution Code Description (low-level design): 

1. **First, import the necessary Python libraries.** Faker is used to generate fake data, pandas is used for data manipulation, docx is used to read and write Word 
documents, nltk is used for natural language processing, and streamlit is used to create a web app.
2. **Initialize Faker**: Faker is a Python package that generates fake data. In this project, it's used to generate fake doctor's reports.
3. **Generate Doctor's Note**: This project will use Faker to generate a fake doctor's report, which it then writes to a text file. Currently Doctor's notes were created from ChatGPT and hard-coded as sample files. 
4. **Downloads necessary NLTK data**: The script uses the nltk library to download the 'punkt' and 'stopwords' 
datasets, which are used for tokenizing text and filtering out common words, respectively.
5. **Loads and reads files**: The script includes functions to load and read text files. These functions are used to read the doctor's reports that were previously saved.
6. **Summarizes reports**: The script includes a function to summarize a report. This function tokenizes the 
text, filters out common words, and identifies the most important sentences to include in the summary.
7. **Writes summaries to files**: The script includes functions to write the summaries to text files
8. **Creates a Streamlit app**: The script uses Streamlit to create a web app that allows users to upload 
a doctor's report in .txt, .docx, or .xlsx format. The app then reads the report, generates a summary, and 
writes the summary to a .txt file
